 **Project Overview**

Vision AI is an accessibility tool designed to assist visually impaired individuals. 
The application provides real-time scene understanding, object detection, text-to-speech conversion, and personalized suggestions based on image content.

**Key Features:**

**Scene Analysis:** Generate clear and concise descriptions of uploaded images.

**Object Detection:** Highlight objects and potential obstacles in images.

**Personalized Assistance:** Provide actionable suggestions based on the context of images.

**Text-to-Speech:** Extract text from images and convert it into an audio format.

**Main Components**

**Frontend (Streamlit):**

Displays an interactive user interface for uploading images and viewing results.

Includes tabs for different functionalities: Scene Analysis, Object Detection, Assistance, and Text-to-Speech.

**Backend:**

**Object Detection:** Utilizes PyTorch's Faster R-CNN model for detecting objects.

**Text Extraction:** Leverages Tesseract OCR for extracting text from images.

**Generative AI Integration:** Uses Google Generative AI to provide detailed image descriptions and personalized assistance.
